# 📊 Employee Productivity and HR Analytics – ML Project

This project analyzes employee satisfaction and productivity using machine learning techniques. It combines datasets from two different HR-focused sources to build insights on employee attrition, satisfaction, and performance. The project includes data visualization, feature engineering, and predictive modeling using Random Forests and PCA.
